Git is the key tool we use to allow multiple people to work on the same code base. Git takes care of merging everyone's contributions smoothly. Hence, learning how to use Git is critical to contributing to open source.

Exercise 1: Initial setup

First things first, you should start by clone this project to your local Repo. 
There're things that you take care of:
GitConfig: Make sure that this local Repo is using your GitHub account and know the difference between the local Configuration for each Repo and Global Configuration and which one replaces the other
For this Repo, you will be using your own GitHub account so you need to configure your account accordingly.

Exercise 2: Your First Commit

Now We should make our new commit, for this exercise it will be adding new text file with your name. for example: ataha.txt. Your commit should be descriptive for easier changes tracking.
After committing your changes you should push it to the master branch.

Exercise 3: Edit your Commit

  We have already created a text file with our names but we need to 
  add another java file to the same commit. 
  Take Care that you need to add it to the same commit not different commit.
  It will be yourname.java

Exercise 4: Add new files and make it untrackable

  Add a new file and make it only locally accessible means it shouldn't be tracked
Add new text yourname_myuntracked_File.txt
Take a screenshot with gitstatus command
Add the screenshot to your local Repo
Commit only the screenshot and push it to the repo

Exercise 5: Edit old file

  Edit yourname.txt file and add hello yourname inisde it
  Note: Take care of handling unstaged files when you have commit to push
Edit yourname.txt file
Add new file called yourname2.txt
Commit only the modified file not the new one which will be in this case yourname.txt and push it to the repo

Exercise 6: Linear Changes

  Should we use Pull or Fetch and rebase in order to get the latest changes 
  on the master branch and have linear changes??
Do your Search
Add your Findings and what you recommend in a new File called yourname_myfindings.txt
Commit this file and push it to the repo
You should have a file called yourname2.txt that hasn't been staged
Remove this file ( Check git reset and how to use it)
