Pull and merge
the only benefit in using pull and merge in a project is preserve the complete history of your project and avoid the risk of re-writing public commits 
otherwise it will be a conflict state when more than one merge at same time to project

Fetch and rebase 
this process can add ordered commits to the final stage reached with repository so it will be clean and linear git commit history
